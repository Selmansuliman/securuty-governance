## Policy
1. Access must be role-based or need-to-know.
2. Privileged accounts require justification, approval and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
3. Onboarding/offboarding processes must remove access in a timely manner (HR/IAM integration).
4. Quarterly access reviews for critical systems.

## Controls & Evidence
