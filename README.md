# This repository contains a selection of projects and work samples that I am able to share publicly.
These items represent a portion of the initiatives I contributed to during my role as an Information Security Manager within a government entity responsible for national-level cybersecurity governance.
I played an active role in delivering these projects, particularly in areas related to information security, policy development, regulatory compliance, and strengthening national cybersecurity capabilities
